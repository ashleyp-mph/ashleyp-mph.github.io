**Welcome to my Professional Website!**

Hi, I’m **Ashley**! I am an emerging public health professional with a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics and a strong academic background in biology, chemistry, and data science. My training has equipped me with skills in statistical programming, data management, and research design, and I’m passionate about using these tools to generate insights that improve health outcomes and promote equity.

Looking ahead, my goal is to build a career at the intersection of data, research, and public health practice—whether through advancing innovative approaches to clinical research, supporting data-driven decision-making in healthcare, or contributing to strategies that make public health systems more effective and accessible. I am eager to grow as a professional, take on new challenges, and collaborate with others who share a commitment to improving community health.

Outside of work, I enjoy exploring creative outlets like anime, pilates, barre, hot yoga, and spending time in the kitchen baking and cooking. I’m always open to making new connections, sharing ideas, and discovering opportunities that inspire growth both personally and professionally.
