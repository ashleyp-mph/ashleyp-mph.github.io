**Hi, I’m Ashley! Welcome to my Professional Website!**

 I’m an emerging public health professional with a Master of Public Health in Biostatistics and a strong foundation in biology, chemistry, and data science. I’m passionate about using data—through statistical programming, research design, and data management—to generate insights that improve health outcomes and advance equity.

My goal is to grow a career at the intersection of data, clinical research, and public health practice, exploring innovative approaches that make health systems more effective and accessible.

Outside of work, I enjoy anime, pilates, barre, hot yoga, and spending time in the kitchen baking and cooking. I’m always excited to connect, share ideas, and explore opportunities that inspire both personal and professional growth.
